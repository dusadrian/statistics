Description: The majority of functions in this package are designed to facilitate
undestanding the statistical concepts taught in the class (such as the functions to
create graphics or areas under the normal curve), while some are designed to ease
calculations for the lab exercises (for instance the degrees of freedom or the
pooled variation for two independent samples).
