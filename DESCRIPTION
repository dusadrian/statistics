Description: The majority of functions in this package are designed to facilitate
 undestanding the statistical concepts taught in the class (such as the functions to
 create graphics or areas under the normal curve), while some are designed to ease
 calculations for the lab exercises (for instance the degrees of freedom or the
 pooled variation for two independent samples).
